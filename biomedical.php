        <p>
    The Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering of University of Moratuwa conducts the only 
    Biomedical Engineering program in Sri Lankaâ€™s State University System. Biomedical Engineering focuses on 
    applications of engineering and technology in the fields of medicine and biology. This relatively novel 
    field straddles a wide area of engineering disciplines such as electronic, computer, electrical, mechanical, 
    chemical and material engineering as well as biology and medicine.<br /><br />
    
    At University of Moratuwa we engage in a wide range of research and industrial projects related to 
    Biomedical Engineering by bring together students, scientists, engineers and physicians from multiple 
    disciplines to disseminate knowledge and solve complex problems. Medical Instrumentation, Medical Imaging, 
    Bio Signal Processing, Biomechanical Engineering, Prosthetic Devices, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, 
    Bio nanotechnology, Neural engineering, Rehabilitation engineering and Bio robotics are some of the areas 
    that we are interested in.<br /><br />
    
    Exmo-2017 will be an incredible experience for the general public and tech enthusiasts to witness how 
    Biomedical Engineering at University of Moratuwa contributes to the development and application of 
    engineering concepts and methods to provide new solutions to biological, medical and healthcare problems 
    of Sri Lanka and the world at large.
