          <p>
            Department of Electrical Engineering of University of Moratuwa is the best place to have a 
            glorious seat of learning in Electrical Engineering. The department is committed to produce 
            Electrical Engineering graduates that have been trained to face a diversity of challenges with 
            emphasis on natural relevance, innovation and creativity and employability.<br /><br />

            As a department with a broad scope of power engineering, electrical installation, electrical 
            machinery and system automation and robotics, the department is planning to share out the 
            technical knowledge with general public on the upcoming event “EXMO-2017”. It will be a 
            non-intersecting opportunity for them to acknowledge well equipped laboratories dedicated 
            to the areas of Electrical Measurements, Power Systems, Electrical Machines, Power Electronics, 
            High Voltage, Electrical Installation and Robotics and Automation.<br /><br />

            Special seminars, awareness programs and A/L practical will be conducted to gain hands on 
            experiences, discarding misconceptions on electrical field and giving day today electrical knowledge.
